# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Sure, here's a README file for your React + Vite project along with instructions on how to run it using Docker:

# React + Vite Sample Project

This is a sample project demonstrating how to set up a React project using Vite, along with instructions on how to containerize it with Docker.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- Docker (optional, if you want to run the project using Docker)

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sample-react-vite.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd sample-react-vite
```

Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

### Running with Docker

If you prefer running the project using Docker, make sure you have Docker installed and follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build . -t sample-project:v1.0
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 sample-project:v1.0
```

This will build and run the Docker container, exposing the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
